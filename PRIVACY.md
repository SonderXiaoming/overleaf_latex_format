# Privacy Policy

Overleaf Formatter is a Chrome extension designed to format LaTeX code within Overleaf
. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it.

## Data Collection and Usage

This extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information.
All operations (such as code formatting) are performed locally in your browser.

The only data this extension processes is the LaTeX code content within the Overleaf editor. This data is used exclusively to reformat and display your document more clearly. It is never stored, transmitted, or shared outside your device.

## Permissions

The extension requests the following permissions:

scripting – to inject the formatting logic into the Overleaf editor.

contextMenus – to provide a right-click option for formatting.

tabs – to identify the active Overleaf tab where formatting should be applied.

Website content (Overleaf) – to read and modify the LaTeX code inside the Overleaf editor for formatting purposes only.

These permissions are strictly limited to enabling the extension’s functionality. They do not allow access to personal data, browsing history, or external websites.

## Third-Party Services

This extension does not use analytics, tracking scripts, advertising networks, or third-party services of any kind.

## Data Sharing

We do not sell, share, or transfer any information to third parties. Since no personal data is collected, there is nothing to share.

## Children’s Privacy

This extension is safe for all users and does not knowingly collect information from children.

## Updates to this Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy if necessary (for example, to comply with new regulations). Any updates will be published in the GitHub repository.
